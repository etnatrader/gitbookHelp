However, before you can proceed to deposit or withdraw funds, first establish an ACH relationship between Digital Advisor and your banking account. To do so, click **Choose bank**.

This will re-direct you to the banking selection page where you can select a previously linked banking account or link a new one by clicking **add a new** at the top.

# Knowledge Base

## Introduction

ETNA Trader's knowledge base represents a collection of troubleshooting articles and how-to guides that explain how to deal with the most frequently occurring issues and also how to configure ETNA Trader. Whether you have a certain service not working properly or whether you need to configure margin rates and commissions, the knowledge base is likely the place to feature such content.

The knowledge base consists of two sections:

* **Troubleshooting**. This section walks you through the most commonly experienced issues and bugs.

{% page-ref page="troubleshooting.md" %}

* **How-to Guides**. This section explains how to perform basic procedures like enabling two-factor authentication, configuring notifications, linking widgets together, etc.

{% page-ref page="how-to-guides/" %}

Each of the two sections contains different subsections that cover different functionality and different segments of ETNA Trader \(the back office, the web app, the mobile apps, etc.\).

# How to Create a New Trading Account

### Introduction

From time to time traders need to create a new trading account to test a new strategy or reset their current trading account. A new trading account will have an initial deposit, no orders and no positions, thereby enabling the trader to start anew.

ETNA Trader enables traders to own several trading accounts.

### Creating a New Trading Account

To create a new trading account, navigate to ETNA Trader's web terminal. In the header, expand the drop-down menu containing the list of your trading accounts and click **Edit**.

Now you can proceed to use the new trading account to open new positions, deposit and withdraw funds, etc.

### Switching the Account in Mobile Apps

After switching trading accounts in the web terminal, perform the same operation in the mobile app. Go the **Account** tab and then tap on the number of the current trading account.

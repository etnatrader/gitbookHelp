# ACH Transfers

### Introduction

ACH transfers facilitate deposits and withdrawal of funds to/from your trading accounts. To perform such transfers, you first need to establish an ACH relationship with one of your bank accounts. Once this relationship is established, you will be able to quickly deposit or withdraw funds without having to repeatedly specify you banking information.

### Creating ACH Relationships

To create a new ACH Relationships, navigate to the **Funds Account Transfer** widget and open the **ACH Relationship** sub-tab. Click **Link a Bank Account**.

### Monitoring ACH Transfers

Once you've submitted a deposit or withdrawal request, its state will change to **Submitted**, meaning that it's currently under review by an administrator. Once they approve the request, its state will change to **FundsPosted** — i.e., the funds have been transferred and are now waiting for clearance. The final state of the request is **Complete** — i.e., the funds have been cleared and can be used to place trades.

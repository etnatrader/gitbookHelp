# Check Transfers

### Withdrawing Funds with Checks

In addition to ACH transfers, ETNA Trader also enables traders to withdraw funds from their trading account by means of a check. In this case a check with the specified sum will be sent to the address specified by you in the account opening form \(the one you filled out when opening the trading account\).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Check transfers are relevant only for withdrawing funds.

To withdraw funds using checks, select **Check Request** on the Funds Transfer tab. Specify the amount to be withdrawn \(in USD\). If you would like to withdraw all funds altogether and close the account, select the **Total distribution and close account** checkbox. Specify the memo if necessary, and the select the preferred delivery method:

* Standard;
* Overnight;
* Saturday;
* Overnight to Broker;
* Print at firm.

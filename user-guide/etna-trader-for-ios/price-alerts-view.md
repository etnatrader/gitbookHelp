# Price Alerts View

### Introduction

The fourth tab of ETNA Trader for iOS — **Price Alerts **— is responsible for displaying the trader's price alerts. A price alert is a scheduled notification that will go off when the specified target price is reached for a specific security. For example, if you want to be notified when the price of the Netflix stock reaches $500, you can create a price alert for the stock with the following condition: `>= 500`.

Price alerts are shared between all platforms of ETNA Trader, meaning all alerts created in the mobile apps will function in the web terminal and vice versa.

### Creating a New Price Alert

To create a new price alert, tap on the **Quick Alert **textfield.&#x20;

Next, search for the required security and then tap on it. You will be prompted with the alert creation view where you need to specify the following parameters:

1. **Reference price**. This is the price that will be pitted against the target price. Possible values: **Last**, **Bid**, **Ask**.
2. **Alert condition**. This is the condition of the price alert. Possible values: **≥** (greater than or equal to), **≤** (less than or equal to).
3. **Price**. This is the target price of the price alert. Once this price is reached, the price alert will go off.
4. **Expiration Date**. This is the date on which the price alert will expire.
